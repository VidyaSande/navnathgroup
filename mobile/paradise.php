      <p>Paradise has never been about places. It exists in moments, in connections and in flashes across time. We present you the concept of life that is based on offering comfort, convenience and privacy to the fullest. The location not at all a scenic holiday place far away from city but it is in fact your same home that gives you grand view of your life from the elevated lifestyle and the perfect landscape you have ever laid your eyes on.</p>
      <p>Every aspect of this development is crafted to maximize your quotient of luxury. The project is located in Mulund East, which is a suburb in north-east of Mumbai. Mulund is also a railway station on the central railway line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway. It is nestled alongside the foothills of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park with easy access to the Eastern Express Highway and Navi Mumbai.</p>
      <p>As you envision your home amidst an eye catching landscape, we have meticulously planned every detail of this project so that each home makes a statement. This project has another aspect of our social responsibility towards a class of people in our society that stay in shanty structures in unhygienic environment, not by choice but by compelling circumstances. It is imperative to enhance their standard of living and for which an authorized dwelling unit is a first step in the right direction. We are committed to this separate rehabilitation scheme of buildings where basic amenities and housing facilities will create an iconic identifier in the elevated lives of the people.</p>
      <p>We invite you to be a part of this project to fulfil your promises. Because nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anybody can start today and make a new ending...</p>
