      <h3 style="color:#fc8f39;">GENTLE GIANT'S GALLOPING GENERATIONS</h3>
      <p>Moving on with the generations is not the only reason of our existence. We at <b>Navnath Group</b> count every single moment of our work to fulfill dreams of countless happiness of the lives. Ever since its inception in 1910, Navnath group is reoriented during its journey with the emerging global culture and lifestyles.</p>
      <p>The foundation of today's successful business laid in 1910 by <b>Late Shri Chintaman Joshi.</b> A first drop of sweat went into the establishment of a new transport company named as Chintaman Parshuram & Co. The company was experiencing expansion in the same transportation business when <b>Mr. Ballal Joshi,</b> son of Late Shri Chintaman Joshi took responsibilities on his strong young shoulders. A son who was lessoned ethical and transparent business skills under the wings of his father slowly enhanced the capabilities under a new banner of M. K. J. & Company.</p>
      <p>In 1975, the company witnessed the most influential paradigm shift in its business when Mr. Ballal Joshi diversified into construction activity by establishing a new firm named as Shree Chintamani Builders. Every step in this business had steadily focused on creating a better experience in every aspect of life. The success story which already spanned across decades continues to achieve higher targets relentlessly, for excellence in architecture and quality constructions.</p>
      <p>The business had progressively expanded its footprint in various parts of Mumbai and other regions. In 2007, we aligned this business to better leverage the strengths of its existing projects and the synergies from the new developments. Our singular goal is to provide ONE structure, ONE offering and ONE face to our people. Under a spiritual influence Navnath Group was evolved with a legacy of supreme principles - honesty, selflessness, austerity and devotion of nine super-super human beings.</p>
      <p>While rooting deep into believes of the people, <b>Mr. Vaibhav Joshi</b>, son of Mr. Ballal Joshi stepped in 1980 and eventually became a partner in Prasad Constructions in 1985. A man who blessed with a heritage of values and culture from his forefathers envisions every project and each minute detail in it. In 1995 and 2001, Mr. Vaibhav Joshi set up his own proprietary concerns with Neelam Constructions and Mukul Constructions.</p>
      <p>Today <b>Mr. Shardool Joshi</b>, son of Mr. Vaibhav Joshi is working on residential and commercial projects along with his father. The higher standards set by the duo in its pursuit to transform into a group to reckon with. In order to achieve the scalability required to undertake large developments, we never compromise on outsourcing work. Our own engineers, equipments, machineries and engendered experienced labour make us 'Special ONE'.</p>

      <h3 style="color:#fc8f39;">MILESTONES</h3>
      <p>A journey of thousand miles begins with a single step. This was the very first step in 1975 when a new firm was established as "Shree Chintamani Builders". The first residential project was completed in the same year at Mulund.</p>
      <p>It is said that do not follow where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. We proved it in our <b>1st project</b> under newly developed "Prasad Constructions" in 1988. In spite of all adversities, a beautiful temple of Shree Ram Siddhi Vinayak was erected 1100 feet above sea level at Kanakeshwar.</p>
      <p>We believe that Navnath Group is born for a purpose and is blessed with the power to achieve it. In 1991 we reached a landmark when <b>10th residential project</b> was completed successfully by "Prasad Constructions" coincidently at the same place – Mulund, where we had started 16 years back.</p>
      <p>We worked hard in silence and let our success to become the noise. Almost 20 years after our start of this journey, in 2006 we had completed our <b>1st commercial project</b> of Transworld Infotech Limited which is an international call center in Pimpri, Pune. The project was executed under "Mukul Constructions" and it was 3rd in a row for this newly developed firm in 2001.</p>
      <p>The whole difference between construction and creation is that a thing constructed can only be loved after it is constructed but a thing created is loved before it exists. Shrirang Niwas is our own creation that took place in 2009. It is a home of B. C. Joshi and his son who are the founder of Navnath Group. This is a place where our feet may leave but our heart will always be in. This is a place which reminds us that we will never make it our milestones if we can’t make it through our moments.</p>
      <p>If you are persistent, you will get it. If you are consistent you will keep it. The legacy of this business inspires us even after 4 decades. In 2016, we have finished another landmark project that has been executed by "Navnath Infrastructures Private Limited". This is the 1st residential project in Dapoli and the <b>20th successful project</b> in the list.</p>
