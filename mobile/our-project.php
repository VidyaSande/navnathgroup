      <p>If we had no winter, the spring would not be so pleasant; if we had no adversity, prosperity would not be so welcome. We are not born successful. It’s not trait you inherit to succeed in life. One must have the courage, determination and strength to overcome all obstacles put in their path on the road to success. Over the past few decades, the journey of Navnath Group has found its purpose, has grown to reach its maximum potential and has sowed seeds that benefit others.</p>
      <p>We, at Navnath Group build up walls not to keep other out but to see who cares enough to break them down. We know that the spaces touch life in myriad ways. Therefore we always remain committed to create a healthy relationship between these spaces and the lives. Our every project understands the demands of a global lifestyle. Mumbai – A city which has its own colors and flavors was our obvious choice to start this journey in 1975. Our first 8 residential projects were completed by Shree Chintamani Builders. Most of them were located at Mulund – A jewel of suburbs where an average construction area was more than 10,000 square feet.</p>
      <p>The vibration of gratitude attracts more positive things into your life. We felt that could be the reason for our first divine connects in 1988 when the temple of Shree Ram Siddhi Vinayak was constructed under Prasad Constructions at Kanakeshwar in Alibaug district. The major challenge of this project was to erect the temple on 1100 feet above the sea level. Till 2009, Navnath Group had completed various residential, commercial and social infrastructure projects that had not only enhanced the lives but had also offered a beautiful mixture of contemporary architecture, systematic project execution and a high quality in the construction.</p>
      <p>Our recent projects of Navnath Nagari and Strawberry Hills take your soul to an inexhaustible good nature which is one of the most precious gifts of heaven, spreading itself like oil over the troubled sea of thoughts and keeping the mind smooth and equable in the roughest weather.</p>
